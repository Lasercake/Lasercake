All of these carry an implicit "TODO, fix this, at least if there's a clean way to do so".

"Does the wrong thing"-type deficiencies:

- Inactive grouped water tiles next to air don't get activated when the group starts having pressure that would push them.
- Water moves in the six cardinal directions a little too much. (scenarios "tower2" and "tower3" illustrate this especially).
- Water going up an initially-empty tunnel moves oddly, by stages (see scenario "pressure_tunnel"). It should be possible to fix this by tweaking the rules about when a tile becomes groupable.
- If a tile vanishes in the middle of an ocean, it doesn't activate the tile directly below it (though it should)

"Doesn't do something it could be able to"-type deficiencies:

- We don't have infinite oceans yet.
