Mighty principles:

Things the player doesn't start shouldn't take any processing time.
Everything should move continuously unless it has a reason to be tile-aligned.


Petty principles:

The axis-aligned terrain (water mechanics...) simulates without regarding mobile objects. Mobile objects move on their own and mess with the terrain or actively get messed with by it.
