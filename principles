Mighty principles:

Things the player doesn't start shouldn't take any processing time.
Everything should move continuously unless it has a reason to be tile-aligned.


Petty principles:

The axis-aligned terrain (water mechanics...) simulates without regarding mobile objects. Mobile objects move on their own and mess with the terrain or actively get messed with by it.
"int" denotes a Very Small Number (e.g. coordinate numbers 0-2). Anything of real magnitude should be typedef'd.
Anything that blocks you after it hits you must collision-detect with your 'personal space shape'. Anything that doesn't block you after it hits you (either it ceases to exist or just passes through you with an effect, or...) is free to use your detailed shape. ("You" and "your" refer to any mobile object). This is because it's a terrible idea to let complicated shapes get tangled up with each other.
