Lasercake currently depends on the following libraries:
(You'll need the development headers.)

Boost -- http://www.boost.org/
SDL -- http://www.libsdl.org/
OpenGL

and tools:

GNU Make (or build Lasercake yourself. The first few lines
    of the Makefile are the only interesting thing in it).
A recent C++ compiler (e.g. GCC >= 4.6, CLang >= 3.0)
    that supports the C++0x features Lasercake uses.

To build, run 'make' from the command-line.
It will give you an executable 'lasercake'.
Then you can run that and/or put it anywhere you like on
your computer.

These build instructions have been tested on Linux
[Arch Linux as well as Debian Testing, x86_64, Jan 2012].
Please tell us if you try to build it elsewhere,
no matter how successful you are!

If you're developing, if you really want, you can use
'make lasercake-debug', which compiles without optimizations.
The game will run incredibly slowly, but compiles
faster and has slightly better debugging backtraces.
'make lasercake-clang' builds with Clang rather than GCC,
if you want to try that.
