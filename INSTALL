Lasercake currently depends on the following libraries:
(You'll need the development headers.)

Boost -- http://www.boost.org/
SDL -- http://www.libsdl.org/
OpenGL
optionally, Glib (for a small speed improvement. To
                   disable, pass -DGLIB=OFF to cmake)

and tools:

CMake
A recent C++ compiler (e.g. GCC >= 4.6, CLang >= 3.0)
    that supports the C++0x features Lasercake uses.

To build, run 'cmake' then 'make' (or use your favorite CMake
interface).  (If developing, using ./dev-build.py might
float your boat better.)
It will give you an executable 'lasercake'.
Then you can run that and/or put it anywhere you like on
your computer.

These build instructions have been tested on Linux
[Arch Linux as well as Debian Testing, x86_64, Jan 2012].
Please tell us if you try to build it elsewhere,
no matter how successful you are!
