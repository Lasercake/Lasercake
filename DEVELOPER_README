== Fonts ==

To add (or remove) a font, you need to make the following changes:
* Add a .ttf font file to resources/
* Remember that Lasercake is GPLed so you shall also:
  Include your most-preferred format for editing the font next to the .ttf.
* List this file in fonts.qrc
* Add another QFontDatabase::addApplicationFont line in main.cpp
* Find out the "font name" of the font so you can refer to it in your code
* Rebuild Lasercake (these fonts are embedded in the executable)
