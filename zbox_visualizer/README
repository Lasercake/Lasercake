This program shows,
from the viewpoint of a camera circling a central point,

* A blue moving/sizechanging box. It's moving back and forth and oscillating in size in various ways according to several sine waves defined in zbox_tester::update().

* Bright red zboxes that the item is presently in

* Dim red zboxes that also have to be in the tree (in order to contain at once all the bright red zboxes that are necessary) (For example, when the blue box is crossing a large power-of-two coordinate in x, y, or z space.)

It's for purposes of debugging or of curiosity.
